Coursera getting and cleaning data project
comments are in the code itself, making it largely self explanitory
any code book explaining the variables would essentially duplicate the readMe that comes with the original data set.
the smallTidy.txt data file gives the averages by activity and by volunteer test subject for each of the 12 "measurements":
  i.e.  linear acceleration in units of "g" in X,Y, and Z, mean and standard deviation, and 
  rotational accelerations in units of radians/second/second, again mean and stadard deviation for X, Y, and Z axes
